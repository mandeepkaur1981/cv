            <p class="my-profile">
              Opus is a proprietary product of Re:Sound used for import,
              processing, exchange and payment generation for music industry
              stakeholders like record makers and performers. With a windows
              forms based architecture, it has various sub-domains like import
              of Repertoire from music rights holders like record labels and
              artists. It has the ability to cleanse, match and then process
              payments for users based on value per play for the designated
              music tracks. It is integrated with their financial payout product
              EPICOR to allow and process the payments. At the same time,
              Re:Sound’s portals created for artists globally, eligible for
              remuneration from use/reproduction of music rights allows music
              creators to register and send their repertoire and see the
              payments sent to them. With both a desktop and web access to the
              same data, the data is always current and integrated in a timely
              manner.
